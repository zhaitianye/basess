## documentation

Basess Is a basic set of styles, types, and componentization used with BootStrap.But it is smaller, simpler and more powerful than BootStrap.

## Use version selection and dependencies

### PC端

> Regular PX layout can be raster system to the mobile end, which is called PC end

  * Only need to quote dist/css/basess.min.css

### mobile terminal

> completely rem layout,100% restore the design draft

* dist/ CSS /basess-moble. Min. CSS must be referenced
* dist/ CSS /basess-moble.min.js must be referenced
  
### Projects that rely on bootstrapping or other responsive components

> is a truncated version that removes style resets and the underlying raster system, leaving only the underlying CSS.Ensures compatibility with other components.

* simply refer to dist/ CSS /basess- cut-min.css

## solution

### style reset

> has no style reset if it relies on dist/ CSS/basess-cut-min.css

The style reset is to ensure compatibility and consistent presentation of each browser, which is automatically controlled by default and does not allow unnecessary operations.

### Grid system

> has no grid system if it relies on dist/ CSS /basess-cut. Min. CSS

The raster system adopts the same specification as bootstarp. Please refer to the raster system of bootstarp for details

* subject
  * the container
    * main body, margin auto on left and right sides, automatically ADAPTS to wide screen
* grid layout
  * col - 1 ~ col - 12
    * box layout, width split into 12 equal parts
  * col - xs - 1 col - xs - 12
    * layout with screen width less than 768px (often used on mobile phones)
  * col - sm - 1 col - sm - 12
    * layout with a screen width of 768-992px (often used for narrow-screen tablets)
  * col - md - 1 ~ col - md - 12
    * layout with a screen width of 992-1200px (often used for widescreen tablets)
  * col - ~ col - lg lg - 1-12
    * layout with screen width greater than 1200px (often used on computers and large screens)
* grid hidden display
  * visible-xs visible-sm visible-md visible-lg
    * used to display blocks in different sizes
  * hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg
    * used to hide blocks in different sizes
